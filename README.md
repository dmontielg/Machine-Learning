MACHINE LEARNING

The goal of this project is to look for transcriptome variation between different brain tissues. 
For this analysis RNA sequencing data is used which contains 1259 samples and 10.574 genes. 
The data is generated by the Genotype Tissue Expression consortium. 

We used different methonds including Supervised and Unsupervised Learning such as LDA, KNN, SVM, PCA among others.
